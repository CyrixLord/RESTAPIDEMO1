rest API demo created from lynda.com to get an understanding on using MVC core with REST

I am using MVC Core 2.0. I have already been using asp.net MVC core 2.0 to build a simple web app, but 
I was interested to see if I can do some cool things using the REST api to make it easier to have a 
central area that responded to requests from any mobile tablet or other device which would make the clients easier to make.
I could write apps instead of using a central web page. It would be a great stepping stone as I would like to also learn to write apps
on devices like android phone and tablets and perhaps something for mint linux.

rather than building a webpage that had to adjust to each of these formats d(tablet, phone, apple, PC etc) I thought 
learning to build a rest api would give me additional options depending on what was needed in a particular project.
